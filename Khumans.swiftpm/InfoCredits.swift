/// Khumans is a narrative experience that aims to tell a powerful message using the touch interface in an unusual way. As a person with a background in Communications & Media Studies, one of the things I love the most about technology is that allows us to add additional layers of meaning to the stories we tell. A layer in which the meaning is not shown but felt.

/// A person in my life has been struggling with major depressive disorder for many years, and I observed her daily struggle. What surprised me the most is how sometimes depression can be invisible to an outside observer and so tiring for people who suffer from it. I saw her being drained of all energies just by doing regular daily activities. “I feel everyone is walking normally, and I have to carry an incredibly heavy backpack” was a sentence from this person that stuck with me.
///
/// The touch interface allowed me to make users feel this struggle: a simple tap gesture, something that we do mindlessly hundreds of times every day, suddenly becomes a struggle, hard to do, and fatiguing. The effort now becomes real and felt. Something ordinary to us becomes a struggle.
///
/// Technology allows us to elevate art and communication to a new level. Writers use to say “show, don’t tell”, I believe that with technology and the added interactivity we can also make people feel at a sensory level.
/// This is what I love about coding and technology, the opportunities to create something new are endless, be it art, entertainment, or a solution to a problem. The more approachable technology and development become, the more people will be able to tell their stories with it in creative ways.
